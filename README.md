3) The capabilities of servers (i.e., humans) to offer human services is increasing with time.   
4) The consumers who use human services are improving their abilities for service orchestration that they may use services in a more complex and reliable way.  
5) Crowdsourcing (HaaS) looks at work in a stateless manner, by breaking down a large project or set of work into smaller units that each can be completed by a worker with the right expertise.
